Welcome to the HR-Attrition Analysis project! This repository contains everything you need to predict and analyze employee attrition in your company. By utilizing machine learning models and a user-friendly web application, you can gain valuable insights into your workforce.

Phase 1: Data Importing, Preprocessing, and Cleaning

In the first phase, our code handles the crucial steps of importing, preprocessing, and cleaning your employee data. We have a single CSV file named "csv_file_name.csv," which holds all the essential information required for analysis.

Phase 2: Applying Machine Learning Models

Phase 2 is where the magic happens! We apply five powerful machine learning models to your preprocessed and cleaned data. Our arsenal includes:

🎯 Multi Linear Regression
📊 Logistic Regression
🤖 SVM (Support Vector Machines)
🌳 Random Forest
🎲 Decision Tree
These models will help you uncover hidden patterns and factors influencing employee attrition, allowing you to make informed decisions for your organization.

Phase 3: Web Application for Attrition Prediction

To make your experience seamless and interactive, we have built a user-friendly web application for attrition prediction. In this phase, you can input specific employee attributes and predict attrition using the best model from Phase 2: the formidable Logistic Regression model. We have carefully selected the most impactful input attributes based on their effect on attrition, giving you valuable insights into potential causes of employee turnover.
